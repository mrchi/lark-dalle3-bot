## Deployment

### Running the Bot with Default Configurations

To make your bot accessible online, you can leverage services like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/).

1. Compile the bot:
    ```bash
    go build .
    ```
2. Initiate a config file from the provided template and modify the `lark_event_server_addr` as needed:
    ```bash
    cp config.example.json config.json
    ```
3. (Optional) For Lark users, set config `is_feishu` to `false`.
4. Execute the program:
    ```bash
    ./lark-dalle3-bot
    ```

This step ensures that the server is reachable when setting up event subscriptions soon.

### Creating a Feishu/Lark Bot Application

1. On the [Feishu Open Platform](https://open.feishu.cn/app), start by creating a custom app.
2. In menu `Add features`, activate the `Bot` feature.
3. In menu `Permissions & Scopes`, add the following `API Scopes`:
    - `im:message`
    - `im:resource`
    - `im:message.group_at_msg:readonly`
    - `im:message.p2p_msg:readonly`
4. In menu `Event Subscriptions`:
    1. Set `Request URL` with `http(s)://<your domain>:<your port>/dalle3`.
    2. Add the `im.message.receive_v1` event.
    3. Grant these permissions to the new event:
        - `Obtain private messages sent to the bot`
        - `Obtain group messages mentioning the bot`
5. Publish your app through the `Version Management & Release` tab.

**For Lark users, please visit [Lark Open Platform](https://open.larksuite.com/app).**

### Bot Configuration and Restart

From the Feishu/Lark Open Platform:
1. Acquire the `App ID` and `App Secret` from menu`Credentials & Basic Info`.
2. Acquire the `Encrypt Key` and `Verification Token` from menu`Event Subscriptions`.

From Bing:
1. Follow the instructions in the README at [yihong0618/BingImageCreator](https://github.com/yihong0618/BingImageCreator) to obtain your Bing cookie.

**Only for Lark users, please set `is_feishu` to `false` in config file.**

Update your `config.json` with these credentials, then rerun your bot and enjoy the magic.
